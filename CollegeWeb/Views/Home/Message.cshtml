                        Welcome to Aditya Institute of Management 
                        Studies and Research. Our Institute is amongst the 
                        leading B-schools in India and ranked amongst the top 10 
                        B-schools in Mumbai which has created a unique identity 
                        for itself by challenging conventional thinking and 
                        learning in the global market. The AICTE approved PGDM
                        program and the Mumbai University affiliated MMS program 
                        are both known for their excellence in building leadership 
                        skills in more than 400 students each year. A rich co-curricular 
                        experience complements a strong conceptual foundation through 
                        100+ experiential learning opportunities spread across the 
                        duration of all programs. Whether it is through creative problem 
                        solving workshops, case studies, live projects or out bound 
                        training programs, our Faculty selects the pedagogy that’s 
                        best for each course. Our Faculty have been recipients of 
                        many distinguished awards and honors both nationally and 
                        internationally. We also have an impressive roster of innovative 
                        industry speakers who share their experiences in events, seminars 
                        and workshops. Our students are preferred by 500+ recruiters who 
                        seek to select professional managers who are ready for corporate 
                        life with technical knowledge and professionalism. The industry 
                        orientation is strongly developed by weekly Coffee Meets with the 
                        1000+ responsive and engaged alumni who inspire and encourage 
                        students. These Alumni of the Institute are making a measurable 
                        difference in the industry. Global perspective is encouraged 
                        through an international study tour which includes visits to 
                        local companies, business schools and some places of interest.
                        Last year the tour to Singapore enabled students to immerse
                        themselves in another culture and experience the challenges 
                        and opportunities facing organisations outside India. Our 
                        focus is to develop our students as global citizens, with 
                        respect and appreciation for diverse cultures. They should 
                        become confident decision makers to take up leadership roles 
                        in future. Wishing you luck to create meaning in every decision
                        that you take!
